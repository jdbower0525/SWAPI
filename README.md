## SWAPI ##

The Star Wars API is a well known resource for software developers to practice
the use of data organization and pulling information from an API and using it
in a program.

On the landing page, there will be options to list every character in each film,
every vehicle in each film, as well as a list of the films themselves. Under
these buttons, the user will have the option of searching for specific ID
numbers inside of the API.  Searching by name is a function that will be added
on at a later date.

(Note, the API is missing some ID#s, so a blank query is the result of that
ID# not existing.  This is most prevalent in the vehicle search.)

The Star Wars API practice program is meant to help us practice using APIs and getting data out of html in a usable way.
