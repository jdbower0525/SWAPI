## SWAPI ##

The Star Wars API is a well known resource for software developers to practice
the use of data organization and pulling information from an API and using it
in a program.

On the landing page, there will be options to list every character in each film,
every vehicle in each film, as well as a list of the films themselves. Under
these buttons, the user will have the option of searching for specific ID
numbers inside of the API.  Searching by name is a function that will be added
on at a later date.

(Note, the API is missing some ID#s, so a blank query is the result of that
ID# not existing.  This is most prevalent in the vehicle search.)
